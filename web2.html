<p>Git is a free and open-source distributed version control system designed to manage projects of any size with speed and efficiency. 
    It allows multiple developers to collaborate on the same codebase by tracking changes to files and enabling the merging of different versions. Unlike centralized systems, Git provides each developer with a complete local copy of the repository history, facilitating offline work and faster operations like branching and merging. </p>
